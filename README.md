# rctPySim
A pyGame program to make rct in birdseye view with focus on the management side. Programmed on a Raspberry Pi for a Raspberry pi.
However i strive to make it work on both linux and windows machines

For now the script is just in the skeleton building phase as i like to call it but it is meant to be very modular.
It is written in Python 3.2.4 and uses pyGame 1.9.2a0

to run the script simply download it and run it using the command "Pythonx.x pyGame-1.py" where x.x stands for your version.
Like described before this script is developed on version 3.2.4 and is also only tested on 3.2.4 for the time being.

The intention is to add the following featuress:
- Physical button and LED support(Rpi only)
- Attractions take a certain number of squares with a limited amount of squares available
- User has an amount of money and each item placed costs money
- Guests will be monitored via a counter(initially onscreen, later by LEDs(Rpi only)) 
- Very little animation will be added
- Statistics will be added to monitor the wellbeing of the park
- Different types of attractions will be added
- Dynamic events(Initially handled on screen, later by physical buttons(Rpi only))
- Much more to come...

If you would like to help and commit, please do. I am writing this game because i want a game that looks like
i'm working but is still very fun to play. I am writing this to learn python and am by no means good at it.
I have a programming background in PHP and a basic language called "WINDEV".
